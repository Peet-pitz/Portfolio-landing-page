    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
    <p>I am Peter and I did a Diploma in IT. I am also a photographer and venture in car, nature and portrait photography. </p>
    <p>Programming has been a a big interest to me and decided to take a programming class to equip me with the skills necessary to create solutions that make our society a better place to be in.</p>
    <p>I really find cars to be exciting and wonderful masterpieces, well atleast that's how we car enthusiasts see them. Cars are really interesting and filled with awesome technology if you look at them as more than metal or plastic boxes that take you from one place to another. Being a photographer this also lets me combine two things that I passionately love.</p>
    <p>Some of my absolute favorite cars have to be:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Ferrari 250 GTO</li>
       <li>'67 Mustang fastback</li>
       <li>Koenigsegg Agera Rs</li>
       <li>Lamborghini Aventador</li>
    </ul>
